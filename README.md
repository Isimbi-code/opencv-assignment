# OpenCV Assignment: License Plate Detection

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for detecting and annotating license plates in images. The script processes an input image, identifies the license plate, draws a bounding box around it, and outputs the annotated image.

## Features
- Detects license plates in an image using OpenCV.
- Draws bounding boxes around the detected license plates.
- Outputs an annotated image with the detected license plate text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/<your-u/<repository-name>.git](https://github.com/Isimbi-code/opencv-assignment.git)

## Usage

1. Place your input image (e.g., `assign.jpg`) in the project directory.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python process_image.py

3.The annotated output image (assign_result.jpg) will be saved in the project directory.
   


## File Structure

- detect_license_plate.py    # Python script for detecting license plates
- assignment-001-given.jpg  # Input image
- assignment-001-result.jpg # Annotated output image
- README.md                 # Project documentation


## How It Works
1. The script loads the input image using OpenCV.
2. It applies pre-trained machine learning or basic image processing techniques to detect the license plate.
3. Once detected, it draws a bounding box around the license plate.
4. The annotated image is saved to the output directory.
